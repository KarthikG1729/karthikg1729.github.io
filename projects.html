<h2>Light Field Synthesis</h2>

<p> The aim of this project is to generate light field synthesis from single image. The deep learning frame work created takes only single image and generates 
multi plane image representation from which sub aperture views of light field are rendered. Disparity maps are also rendered from Multi Plane Image representation in the intermediate stage.
 Trained on open source dataset - Flowers dataset.   </p>

<h2 style="margin-top:5%">Polyp Segmentation from Gastro-Intestinal Endoscopy images</h2>

<p> The aim of this project is to segment the polyp in gastro intestinal endoscopy images. Polyp is a abnormal portion in intestine 
looks like bulge like structure  where it leads to cancer. I have used GAN based framework to train the dataset. I have designed 
a novel generator architecture for the faster inference. This network segmented polyps with high precision and accuracy. The dataset 
used is open source dataset which is Kvasir - SEG, Clinic DB dataset.    </p>
